# Restful-Commerce
Back-end for an e-commerce application


- Configuring an Express.js API back-end for an e-commerce site, I connected all routes and created the mySQL models to be used within the site.
- The node packages used include sequelize and mysql2 to better construct our database 
- The connections will allow full CRUD operations for this site on the back-end



## Installation
Firstly, open db directory to create database. Then,  open dotenv to add personal mySQL password(if needed). 
Open package.json in integrated terminal to npm i all dependencies. Then, you'll be able to seed info using npm run seed. Insomnia can be used to view and run all CRUD options after running npm watch. This will turn on server.
## Usage

This snippet demonstrates full CRUD operation for an e-commerce's back-end.
